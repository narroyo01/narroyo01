# About Nick Arroyo
What started out as a hobby has now become my profession and I'd like to share some of my work with you! 
I spend a lot of my time either reading, tinkering, or constructing repetitive sounds in sequence which sometimes resembles music.
I'm a maker and builder at heart and enjoy to be hands-on with my work. From building furniture to remodeling my own home, 
from working on cars to working on code, I love to solve problems and create things. My life has been an ever-lasting journey seeking out new ideas
and learning more everyday. So if you see something I can do better let me know, so that I can improve on this journey. 

## Non-Tech things that currently hold my attention
- Being the man my son to looks up to
- Making a dent on the obscene amount of books I've purchased and have never opened  
Jeff Bezos called me and told me he couldn't have gone into space without all my unecessary purchases;  
You're welcome Jeff save me a seat next time will ya'
